## My process

Started the design using a mobile-first approach. Used the media queries to optimize for some desktops, tablets and mobile screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Practiced on writing a clean code, though I feel I have a lot to learn concerning media queries.

### Continued development

More optimization for some screens ignored in the desktop space and also for the iPad Pro.
