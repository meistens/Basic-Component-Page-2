## My process

Started out by sketching the design on paper, then coding the design.

Built using a desktop-first approach, before moving on to style for mobile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Learnt about this cool feature called blend mode, which iI used to overlay the image.

Goes thus

```CSS
mix-blend-mode: multiply;
```

But in all honesty, got that idea from checking out [DarrickFauvel](https://www.github.com/DarrickFauvel/fem07-stats-preview-card-component) repo after checking the slack channel for ideas.

### Continued development

When I am comfortable with using TailwindCSS, I will revisit this challenge (and others too).

Plus, the image might be a bit off from the given design, which is something I will work on behind the scenes.
